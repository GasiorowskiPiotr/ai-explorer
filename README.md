# AI Explorer

Simple log viewer for Microsoft Azure Application Insights, which is also the experiment on how to create Progressive Web Apps.

## Features
1. Add/remove (and store) Application Insights
2. View most of log types (more 'exotic' are coming)
3. Filter by time span and log type
4. View details

## Plans
1. ~~Use AIs to log exceptions :)~~
2. Easier access to Application Insights (without typing AI Key and AI ID) - _Approaching completion - AIE part is done_
3. ~~Implement Service Worker (for assets caching)~~
4. ~~Show summary of Exceptions in header~~
5. ~~Implement all log types~~
6. Implement background sync for exception notifications
7. Tests on different devices - _A lot of fixes for iOS already done_
